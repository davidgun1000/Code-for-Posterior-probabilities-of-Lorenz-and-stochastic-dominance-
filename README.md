# Code-for-Posterior-probabilities-of-Lorenz-and-stochastic-dominance-
This is the code for the paper "Posterior probabilities of Lorenz and stochastic dominance for Australian income distributions"
David Gunawan, William Griffiths, and Duangkamon Chotikapanich (2021) Economic Record.
The main code is main_prog.m.
The main code will generate the posterior probabilities of Lorenz and stochastic dominance. 
Please read the paper for more information.


The user needs to supply their own data.
You need two years of income data with their sampling weights and supply them in the form of two .mat files.

In each .mat file, you need two variables, one for income variable and one for the sampling weight. The main_prog.m will give the posterior probabilities of Lorenz and stochastic dominance. income_overall_2001_used.mat and income_overall_2010_used.mat are the examples of required data for the program. They are simulated data.
